# DataFest
I participated in DataFest, a data hackathon sponsored by many great organizatinos including ASA, Google, UWaterloo and the-cooperators. After 48 hours of intense work, my team received "Honorable Mention" award. I am posting here our 2-page presentation slides, and the jupyter notebooks that I worked on to analyze data.
